# Description

The purpose of this project was to design a Distribution Transformer (6.6KV/220V) using MATLAB. The design steps were coded in MATLAB, and various performance parameters such as Efficiency, Regulation, and Core Loss Current were calculated. The design code was flexible, allowing users to input various design criteria such as transformer KVA, frequency, and cooling method directly into the MATLAB Command Window. After running the simulation, the calculated design parameters were displayed in the MATLAB Command Window for analysis.
